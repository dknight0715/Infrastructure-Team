# V2MOM v2 Draft

## Vision

Enable the project and core teams to achieve their goals through the use of technological tools and resources.

## Values

* Quality: Lead by example; build quality projects
* Accessibility: Ensure that projects we support are accessible
* Transparency: Develop in the open
* Impact within the brigade: Build with, not for
* Responsiveness: Be available

## Methods

* Brigadehub -- will support initiatives within the brigade such as:
  * Making it easy for non-developers to contribute
  * Making projects more discoverable (along with metadata)
  * Marketing / landing page for brigade
* Catalog existing donated resources; obtain new
* Be responsive in Slack, Github, and via Email
* Build and support tools/microservices to support brigade initiatives
* Reach out to and utilize user research guild for projects (particularly Brigadehub)

## Obstacles

* Accessibility tooling is a little sparse
* Lack of user research experience
* Identifying brigade needs

## Measures

* Continued development of brigadehub; beta launch this summer
* Adoption of tools within and outside of the brigade
  * Also Github stats such as stars and forks
* Accessibility audits of tools
* Documented user research of tools/microservices
* Creation of infrastructure project spec (guidelines) for existing and new projects under the Infrastructure umbrella
