Vision

- To enable the SF Brigade core teams with their goals using the technology portal of the site
- To ensure transparency of the organization through dissemination of goals and progress

Value Prop / Value Add

- Add accessibility to site and tools
- Catalog existing resources and what is available
- be the gate-keepers for private resources donated to sfbrigade
- Liaison with other core teams to see what we can do to help them accomplish goals
- Assess the current state of usage on the site / tools (analytics, collect data)
- Based on that data, funnel traffic to most important areas

Methods

- Liaison with core teams, attend their meetings, record + make available meeting recordings
- find and use appropriate testing tools for accessibility
- Lean down the site, make it more *purpose-driven*, implement google analytics, add hooks to EVERYTHING
- learn each of the donated resources, and how to allocate them securely

Obstacles

- time
- communication (internally and with other core teams)
- scheduling - syncing our schedules with each other and with other teams

Measures / Metrics

- Set up and regularly use accessibility testing tools
- Stay active in slack channels
- Weekly meeting for w+t team, outside of liaison meetings
- Collected a MASSIVE amount of analytics data for processing

Culture

- Never let any PR on website age 72 hours without some type of response / tagging
- Any ideas, no matter how small, tracked in github
